# Mobile Development Access

## Current Network Information
- **Local Access**: http://localhost:3000
- **Network Access**: http://192.168.0.183:3000

## Development UI Changes
- ✅ **Next.js Development Overlay Disabled**: The "N" button and development indicators have been removed
- ✅ **Clean Development Experience**: No development overlays will appear on mobile or desktop

## For Mobile Device Access:

### Step 1: Ensure both devices are on the same WiFi network
Make sure your mobile device and development computer are connected to the same WiFi network.

### Step 2: Use the network IP address
On your mobile device, open the browser and navigate to:
**http://192.168.0.183:3000**

### Step 3: If access is blocked by Windows Firewall:
Run this command in PowerShell as Administrator to allow the connection:
```powershell
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Node.js Dev Server" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 3000 -Action Allow
```

## Alternative Scripts:
- `npm run dev` - Server accessible on mobile (hostname 0.0.0.0)
- `npm run dev-local` - Server only accessible locally (hostname localhost)
- `dev-restart.bat` - Clean restart with network IP information

## Troubleshooting:
1. **Can't connect from mobile**: 
   - Check if both devices are on the same network
   - Try disabling Windows Firewall temporarily
   - Restart the development server

2. **Slow loading on mobile**:
   - This is normal for development servers
   - For better mobile performance, use the production build

3. **IP address changed**:
   - Run `ipconfig` to get the new IP address
   - Update the URL accordingly

4. **Development overlay reappears**:
   - This has been disabled in the configuration
   - If it still appears, clear browser cache and reload
